# CLAUDE.md

`bcdb` reads Business Central data directly out of SQL Server native backups
(`.bak`) and BC cloud exports (`.bacpac`) — no SQL Server at runtime, no restore
or import, no service tier. For a `.bak` it parses the MTF container, derives the
page map from the allocation bitmaps, walks the system catalog, and decodes rows
including page compression and off-page LOBs. For a `.bacpac` it reads the zip
container, streams `model.xml` for the schema, and decodes native-BCP data
streams. Both land in one query surface (`IBcSource`).

One command goes the other way: `bcdb restore` writes a source's rows into a database
that already exists (a BC container with its extensions installed), matching tables and
columns by name and refusing anything it cannot carry across exactly. It is the only
command that talks to a SQL Server, and the only one that writes anything.
`README.md` has the user-facing scope; `PROVENANCE.md` records where every
non-obvious structural fact came from and how it was validated.

## Map

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/BcDb.Core/Mtf.cs` | MTF container walk: descriptor blocks, streams, MQDA/MQTL extraction |
| `src/BcDb.Core/PageFile.cs` | the structural page map (GAM/SGAM/DCM/PFS driven), cross-check |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Catalog.cs` | system catalog base tables (sysallocunits, sysschobjs, …) |
| `src/BcDb.Core/TableReader.cs` | IAM chains, per-page PFS filtering, row enumeration |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Records.cs` | FixedVar and compressed (CD) record parsing, CI structure |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Values.cs` | type decoding (vardecimal, datetime family, SCSU dispatch, …) |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Scsu.cs` | full SCSU decoder (UTS #6) |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Lob.cs` | off-row value resolution: text pointers, inline roots, LOB trees |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Symbols.cs` | AL meaning layer: SymbolReference.json from `.app` packages |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Source.cs` | `IBcSource`: the tables/columns/rows contract both containers implement |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Bacpac.cs` | the `.bacpac` zip container, Origin.xml guards, streaming model.xml |
| `src/BcDb.Core/Bcp.cs` | native-BCP row framing: prefix widths, per-type storage-form conversion |
| `src/BcDb.Cli/Program.cs` | the `bcdb` CLI (tables / read / describe / check / verify / restore) |
| `src/BcDb.Cli/RestorePlan.cs` | restore: target schema model, name matching, the refusals |
| `src/BcDb.Cli/RestoreValues.cs` | restore: decoded value → the CLR type the column takes |
| `src/BcDb.Cli/RestoreRowReader.cs` | restore: source rows as the IDataReader a bulk copy consumes |
| `src/BcDb.Cli/SqlRestore.cs` | restore: catalog read, truncate, SqlBulkCopy, the CLI subcommand |
| `tests/BcDb.Tests/` | hermetic unit + end-to-end tests (see rules on skips) |
| `fixtures/` | oracle-exported expected values + the committed `typeprobe.bak` |
| `tools/` | scripts that regenerate the probe databases and fixtures on the oracle |
| `fixtures/typeprobe.bacpac` | sqlpackage export of the same probe database state as `typeprobe.bak` |
| `verify.sh` | the full-file gate against the real demo backups (fails when absent) |

## The oracle

All verification compares against a real SQL Server — container
`bakreader-oracle` (`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest`, sa password in
the container's environment), holding restored copies of the BC 27.5/28.1 demo
backups (`bc275`, `bc281`) and the probe databases. If it is gone, recreate it by
restoring the demo backups from `~/.bcartifacts.cache/sandbox/<v>/w1/` and
running `tools/typeprobe.sql` / `tools/scale.sql`. Fixtures under `fixtures/`
were exported from it with `tools/export-fixtures.sh`.

For `.bacpac` work the oracle plays the same role through `sqlpackage`
(`dotnet tool install -g microsoft.sqlpackage`; the container publishes SQL on host
port **14330**): `/Action:Export` produces a bacpac from a probe database,
`/Action:Import` loads any bacpac back for a `SELECT` comparison.

For `restore` work it is the destination as well as the oracle: the round-trip tests take
a connection string in `BCDB_RESTORE_SQL` and create/drop their own scratch database, and
`verify.sh` passes it in and fails if they report as skipped.

```bash
PASS=$(docker exec bakreader-oracle printenv MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD)
BCDB_RESTORE_SQL="Server=localhost,14330;User ID=sa;Password=$PASS;TrustServerCertificate=True" \
  dotnet test BcDb.sln -c Release
```

## Operating rules

Auto-loaded from `.claude/rules/`. The short version:

- **Clean room**: never read, fetch, or consult any other MDF/backup-reading
  project's code — especially not GPL-licensed code. Derive from Microsoft's
  docs, DBCC PAGE, the files themselves, and the oracle. (`clean-room.md`)
- **Derivations go in `PROVENANCE.md`** with their evidence, in the existing
  style — that file is a deliverable. (`oracle-verification.md`)
- **Loud failures**: anything the reader cannot decode faithfully throws,
  naming the column/type/surface. Never a default value. (`loud-failures.md`)
- **Verify against the oracle, never against yourself.** (`oracle-verification.md`)
- **Never trust catalog metadata at face value** — first_page/root_page/m_objId
  are measurably stale in real files. (`stale-metadata.md`)
- **TDD**, tests that assert real values. (`tdd.md`)
- **No silent skips in CI.** (`no-silent-skips.md`)

## Skills

Project skills under `.claude/skills/` carry the working mechanics distilled from real
sessions — load them instead of rediscovering:

- **derive-structural-fact** — the loop for any decode failure or new format surface
  (diagnose → oracle → known-value probe → RED → fix with guards → validate → PROVENANCE).
- **oracle-ops** — sqlcmd pitfalls, DBCC PAGE, typeprobe/fixture regeneration, verify.sh wiring.
- **perf-check** — credible cold/warm measurement and the current baseline numbers.

## Everyday commands

```
dotnet build BcDb.sln -c Release        # warnings are errors
dotnet test  BcDb.sln -c Release        # hermetic suite (typeprobe.bak + typeprobe.bacpac)
./verify.sh                              # full gate; needs the ~900 MB demo backups
src/BcDb.Cli/bin/Release/net8.0/bcdb check <file.bak>   # page-map self-check on any backup
src/BcDb.Cli/bin/Release/net8.0/bcdb serve <file>       # open once, JSON requests over stdin (the consumer path)
src/BcDb.Cli/bin/Release/net8.0/bcdb restore <file> --to "<connection>" --dry-run   # the one writing command

dotnet publish src/BcDb.Cli/BcDb.Cli.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 -o out
out/bcdb ...                            # the shipping build: self-contained, native
```

`dotnet build` is the JIT build; the tests and `verify.sh` run against it. `dotnet
publish` is Native AOT and is what a one-shot caller should use — a cold single-table
read is 57 ms native against 174 ms JIT, mostly runtime startup and JIT that a short
process never earns back. Quote which build any timing came from (see `perf-check`).
