# BusinessCentral.DbReader

`bcdb` reads Business Central data straight out of the two files a BC database
normally arrives in — a SQL Server native backup (`.bak`) or a cloud export
(`.bacpac`) — with no SQL Server, no restore or import, and no service tier. For a
`.bak` it parses the backup container, maps every database page, walks the system
catalog, and decodes table rows (including page-compressed data and off-page BLOBs)
directly from the file. For a `.bacpac` it reads the zip container, the `model.xml`
schema, and the native bulk-copy data streams. Both paths answer the same commands
and produce the same output, so which file you have only changes the path you pass.

One command goes the other way: `bcdb restore` writes those rows into a database
that already exists — a Business Central container with its extensions installed —
so a cloud export becomes a working local environment without a tenant mount or a
`sqlpackage` import. Reading still needs no SQL Server anywhere; only `restore` does,
and only as the destination.

Any Business Central database file is the target: the format work — pages, the
system catalog, row/page compression, LOB storage, BCP row framing — is the same in
a customer's production file as in Microsoft's demo databases. What has actually
been *verified* is narrower; see "What has been verified" below and read it before
relying on the tool.

**This is an independent implementation.** It was written from scratch against
Microsoft's published documentation, Microsoft's own diagnostic tooling
(`DBCC PAGE`), and direct observation of backup files, with every structural fact
validated against a real SQL Server restore of the same bytes. `PROVENANCE.md`
records where each non-obvious structural fact came from. No other MDF- or
backup-reading project's source code was consulted; in particular, no GPL-licensed
code was read or used. The project is MIT.

## Install

Download the binary for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.DbReader/releases/latest)
— it is self-contained, so nothing else needs installing, not even .NET:

```
chmod +x bcdb-linux-x64
./bcdb-linux-x64 tables <file>
```

Binaries are published for linux-x64, linux-arm64, win-x64, osx-x64 and osx-arm64, with
a `SHA256SUMS` file to check a download against. Each binary also carries a build
provenance attestation naming the workflow, commit and runner that produced it:

```
gh attestation verify bcdb-linux-x64 --repo StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.DbReader
```

The Windows binary is Authenticode-signed as *Stefan Maron Consulting*, and so is the
copy inside the `dotnet tool` package.

The macOS binaries are not notarized. Notarization is free, but it requires a
Developer ID certificate, which requires a paid Apple Developer Program membership,
and this project does not carry one. macOS only quarantines files downloaded by a
browser, so `dotnet tool install -g bcdb` is unaffected and needs nothing. For a
binary downloaded from the releases page, clear the quarantine flag once:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine bcdb-osx-arm64
```

To use it from .NET rather than as a command, reference the library and call
`BcSource.Open(path)` directly — no subprocess, no JSON:

```
dotnet add package BcDb.Core
```

```csharp
using BusinessCentral.DbReader;

using var src = BcSource.Open("MyDatabase.bak");
var table = src.Tables.Single(t => t.Name.Contains("G_L Entry"));
foreach (var row in src.ReadRows(table, src.Columns(table)))
    Console.WriteLine(row["Entry No_"]);
```

Or build it yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.DbReader
cd BusinessCentral.DbReader
dotnet publish src/BcDb.Cli/BcDb.Cli.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 -o out
alias bcdb=$PWD/out/bcdb
```

`dotnet build BcDb.sln -c Release` also works and is what the tests run against, but it
produces the JIT build. Prefer `dotnet publish` for actually using the tool: a one-shot
command is short-lived, and most of its wall clock would otherwise be runtime startup and
JIT. On the BC 28.1 demo backup, a cold single-table read is ~57 ms from the published
binary against ~174 ms from `dotnet build`.

## Usage

`<file>` is a `.bak` or a `.bacpac`; the file type is detected from its contents.

```
bcdb tables   <file>                          list tables with row counts, compression, company
bcdb companies <file>                         list the companies in the database
bcdb read     <file> --table <name> [options] decode rows to pipe-separated text or JSON
bcdb describe <file> --table <name> --symbols <apps>   AL schema: field ids, AL types, SQL columns
bcdb serve    <file> [--symbols <apps>]       open once, answer many requests over stdin/stdout
bcdb restore  <file> --to "<connection>"      write the rows into an existing database (a BC container)
bcdb check    <file.bak>                      cross-check the page map; prints map statistics
bcdb verify   <file> --fixture <f.tsv> ...    compare decoded rows against a fixture file
bcdb --version                                version, platform and build flavor
```

`check` and `validate` inspect the page map, which only a `.bak` has; every other
command works on both file types.

Worked examples against the demo backup shipped in every BC sandbox artifact
(`~/.bcartifacts.cache/sandbox/<version>/w1/BusinessCentral-W1.bak`):

```
# five customers, three columns
bcdb read BusinessCentral-W1.bak --table Customer --company CRONUS \
    --select "No.,Name,City" --top 5

# JSON, with AL field names resolved from the shipped Base Application package
bcdb read BusinessCentral-W1.bak --table "G/L Entry" --company CRONUS \
    --select "Entry No.,Posting Date,Amount" --format json \
    --symbols "Extensions/Microsoft_Base Application_28.1.49838.50621.app"

# the AL view of a table: field numbers, AL types, SQL columns
bcdb describe BusinessCentral-W1.bak --table "No. Series" --company CRONUS \
    --symbols "Extensions/Microsoft_Base Application_28.1.49838.50621.app"
```

- `--table` accepts the AL table name (`No. Series`) or the raw SQL object name.
- `--company` selects the company when a table exists in several (BC 28.1 demo
  databases contain `CRONUS International Ltd_` and `My Company`); a prefix is
  enough (`--company CRONUS`).
- `--app` selects the defining app when two installed apps declare the same
  table name in the same company (legal through AL namespaces — the demo
  database ships `Dimension Set Entry` twice); an app-id prefix is enough
  (`--app 437dbf0e`).
- `--symbols` takes a comma-separated list of `.app` packages or
  `SymbolReference.json` files. The schema is an **input**: pass the apps the
  database was actually built from (the shipped Base Application for demo
  databases; a customer's own extensions for a customer database).
- `--select` takes AL or SQL column names; `--top N` limits rows;
  `--sha256 "Col"` replaces a binary column by the SHA-256 of its bytes, and
  refuses a name that matches no selected column. Names are matched as written
  before they are trimmed, so `--select "A, B"` works and a column whose name
  carries a space (`--select "Reten_ Pol_ Filtering "`) is still addressable.
- `--merge-extensions` joins the base table with its `$ext` companion table on
  the companion's key — the base table's AL primary key, which is not always the
  key the base table is clustered on — and returns one row per AL record.
  Extension fields resolve
  to AL names and field ids through the extending app's symbols (pass the
  extending apps in `--symbols`); a base row without a companion row reads its
  extension fields as NULL. `describe` lists extension fields either way.
- `--format` selects `tsv` (the default) or `json`. `--prefetch` works with any
  command.

An option the command does not accept **fails the command**, exit 1, naming the
option and listing the ones that command takes — the same contract serve has for
request keys. There is one spelling per option and no aliases. The command line is a
programmatic surface too, driven per table from scripts, and nothing there reads the
output: a mistyped `--compayn` silently reading every company, a mistyped `--tpo`
silently dropping the row limit, or `--mergeExtensions` silently returning the base
table without any of its extension fields, is a wrong answer reported as success.
For the same reason an option that takes a value is refused without one instead of
becoming the string `true`, `--top` refuses a value that is not a row count, and a
stray positional argument is refused instead of dropped.

### Reading a cloud export

A BC online environment exports as a `.bacpac`. Everything above works the same way
against one:

```
bcdb tables   MyEnvironment.bacpac
bcdb read     MyEnvironment.bacpac --table "G/L Entry" \
    --company "My Company" --select "Entry No.,Posting Date,Amount" --top 5
```

Two differences are worth knowing:

- The compression column reads `-`. A bacpac stores logical rows, so there is no
  storage compression to report.
- Row counts are counted, not read from a catalog, so `bcdb tables` on a large
  export reads the whole file. `read` and `describe` only touch the table asked for.

### Restoring a cloud export into a container

Reading is one half of what a cloud export is wanted for; the other is getting the
data into a container so a service tier can serve it. `bcdb restore` writes the
rows straight into a database that already exists — no tenant mount, no service
tier, no `sqlpackage` import:

```
# 1. start a container and install the extensions the data came from, as usual
# 2. push the data in
bcdb restore MyEnvironment.bacpac --replace \
    --to "Server=localhost;Database=CRONUS;User ID=sa;Password=…;TrustServerCertificate=True"
```

The container's schema is the authority. Installing the extensions is what creates
the tables; this only carries rows into them, matching source table to target table
by SQL name, and column to column by name. That division is what makes it work with
AppSource apps: whatever the container's apps declare is what the data lands in.

What it does, and refuses to do:

- **A table the target does not have is reported and skipped.** That is the normal
  case — an extension that is not installed — and it costs nothing that was going
  to be written.
- **A column mismatch inside a matched table stops the load**, naming the table and
  column: a source column with no target column, a narrower or differently-typed
  target column, a `NOT NULL` target column with no default and no source. Loading
  those rows anyway would produce a database that looks loaded and is wrong. The plan
  is built before anything is written, so a refusal leaves the target untouched —
  normally it means the container has the wrong version of an extension installed.
  `--skip-mismatched` reports such a table and carries on with the rest; it never
  loads one part way.
- **`--replace` empties each table first.** Without it, a target table that already
  has rows is refused rather than added to — a container's demo data plus a tenant's
  data is neither database.
- **`--dry-run`** prints the whole plan (matched tables, mapped column counts,
  skips and their reasons) and writes nothing. Run it first.
- **`$ndo$…` platform tables are left alone** unless you pass `--include-system`.
  They describe the service tier's own view of the database — which apps are
  installed, which tenant this is — and those answers belong to the container, not
  to the export. Overwriting them breaks the container instead of filling it.
- Rowversion columns are never written (SQL Server stamps its own), identity values
  *are* preserved, and constraints are not checked during the load, so table order
  does not matter.

Values cross as the exact type the column declares: `decimal(38,20)` amounts go over
as `SqlDecimal`, because `System.Decimal` silently rounds values BC actually stores.
Rows are streamed and bulk-copied, so a table larger than memory costs no more than a
small one; `--batch-size` sets the rows per batch.

A `.bak` works as a source too (`bcdb restore BusinessCentral-W1.bak --to …`),
which is the "copy this database into that container" case.

> Note: `bcdb restore` is the only command that talks to a SQL Server. Everything
> else in this tool still runs with no server anywhere.

### Serve mode — many reads over one open file

A one-shot `bcdb read` pays the full open cost (page map or `model.xml` parse,
catalog, column metadata, process start) on every invocation: about 50 ms on the 893 MB
demo backup, and about 1.4 s on a 52 MB cloud export, where `model.xml` has to be parsed
before anything can be read. A program that reads tables one at a time as it needs them
should use `serve` instead:
the backup is opened once, then each stdin line is one JSON request and each
stdout line one JSON response, in order:

```
bcdb serve BusinessCentral-W1.bak
> {"id": 1, "cmd": "read", "table": "CRONUS International Ltd_$Currency Exchange Rate$437dbf0e-84ff-417a-965d-ed2bb9650972", "select": "Currency Code,Starting Date"}
< {"id": 1, "ok": true, "headers": ["Currency Code", "Starting Date"], "rows": [["AED", "2025-03-01"], ...]}
> {"id": 2, "cmd": "read", "table": "no such table"}
< {"id": 2, "ok": false, "error": "no table matches 'no such table'"}
> {"cmd": "quit"}
```

Commands and the keys each accepts, besides `id` and `cmd`:

| `cmd` | keys |
|---|---|
| `read` | `table`, `company`, `app`, `top`, `select`, `sha256`, `merge-extensions` |
| `describe` | `table`, `company`, `app` (needs `--symbols` at startup) |
| `tables`, `companies`, `quit` | none |

A key the command does not accept **fails the request**. There is one spelling per
option and no aliases, so `mergeExtensions` is refused and the error names
`merge-extensions`. This matters because serve is for callers that build requests
in code: a mistyped `tpo` silently dropping a row limit, or a mistyped `compayn`
silently reading every company, is a wrong answer reported as success.

The `id` is echoed back verbatim; a failed request answers `"ok": false`
with the error message and the session stays up. Value formatting matches
`read --format json`. Measured on the demo backup (NVMe): a few ms per
small-table read once the session is warm, and the open cost is paid once. The
same holds for a bacpac: on a 52 MB production export, the first request pays the
one-time `model.xml` parse (~1.4 s including process start) and later reads take
1–25 ms.

## What has been verified

Every claim below is backed by byte- or value-exact comparison against a real
SQL Server (`RESTORE` of the same file, `SELECT`, `sys.*` catalog views,
`DBCC PAGE`) — the project's oracle. The verified inputs are:

- **Microsoft's shipped demo backups** for BC 27.5 and 28.1 (W1): the structural
  page map reproduces a fresh `RESTORE` byte-for-byte on 109,954 of 109,984 /
  114,091 of 114,120 pages; every remaining difference is allocation bookkeeping
  or SQL Server's own during-backup bookkeeping, none of it BC table data.
  Fixture tables (No. Series, Customer, G/L Account, G/L Entry, Tenant Media
  blobs by SHA-256, both companies) decode identical to `SELECT`.
- **A 5.4 GB two-GAM-interval database** with mixed-extent allocations and
  delete/update history, built for the purpose (`tools/scale.sql`): the map is
  byte-identical to its restore on 644,104 of 644,144 pages, and a 590,770-row
  table spanning both intervals decodes line-for-line equal to `SELECT`.
- **A type-probe database** (`tools/typeprobe.sql`, committed as
  `fixtures/typeprobe.bak`) covering every supported type in uncompressed,
  row-compressed and page-compressed storage, both nullable and NOT NULL, LOB
  trees up to 180 KB, row overflow, SCSU text (Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, emoji), and
  column names carrying a leading or trailing space.
- **The same probe database as a `.bacpac`** (`fixtures/typeprobe.bacpac`, exported
  by `sqlpackage`). Both containers are checked against the *same* oracle fixtures,
  so a bacpac read and a backup read of one database must produce identical output;
  17 probe tables are compared through each path on every `dotnet test` and
  `verify.sh` run.

One independent ~23 GB production BC database backup (BC 21 lineage upgraded
to BC 24, SQL Server 2019, heaps, ALTER history, third-party extensions) has
been validated the same way: 3,019,763 of 3,020,080 pages byte-identical to a
fresh restore with every difference accounted for, and six full tables (up to
3.1 M rows) decoding line-for-line equal to `SELECT`; nothing from that file is
committed. One real 52 MB BC cloud export (`.bacpac`, 3,914 tables, 567 with rows)
has been validated the same way: a scan that decodes every value of every row
(178,189 rows, zero failures), plus `sqlpackage /Action:Import` into a SQL Server
and a column-for-column comparison of all 567 populated tables against `SELECT` —
all identical. Nothing from that file is committed either.
Other production files remain untested. The code is written for the
general case and everything outside the verified envelope **fails loudly**
rather than returning partial or guessed data — but treat the first run against
any new class of backup as an experiment, and run `bcdb check` on it (it
cross-checks the structural page map against page self-identification and
reports any disagreement).

## Supported today

- SQL Server native full backups, uncompressed and unencrypted, single data
  file, any number of GAM intervals (databases beyond 4 GB), mixed-extent
  allocations.
- `.bacpac` exports written by `sqlpackage` / DacFx, Data stream version 2.0.0.0.
  The SHA-256 `Origin.xml` records over `model.xml` is verified on read.
- Uncompressed, row-compressed and page-compressed tables (column-prefix
  anchors, page dictionaries, >30-column clusters).
- Types: integers, bit, decimal/numeric (any precision — output is exact to the
  declared scale), datetime, datetime2/date/time (all scales), real/float,
  uniqueidentifier, rowversion, (n)char/(n)varchar (including SCSU-compressed
  Unicode), binary/varbinary, and off-page LOBs: image/text/ntext and
  varbinary(max)/nvarchar(max)/varchar(max), including multi-page LOB trees and
  row-overflow columns.
- Multi-company databases; AL names and types via `SymbolReference.json`.
- Writing those rows into an existing SQL Server database with `bcdb restore`
  (see above): tables and columns matched by name, every type above converted to
  the column's own type, mismatches refused rather than loaded approximately.

## Not supported (fails loudly, by design)

- Backups taken `WITH COMPRESSION` or encrypted backups.
- Multi-data-file databases (Business Central uses one data file).
- Differential and log backups; only the full-backup data copy is read.
- The transaction-log region of the backup is **not replayed**. Measured
  consequence on every verified backup: the only pages this can affect are
  allocation bookkeeping and objects SQL Server itself created *while* the
  backup ran — never settled BC table data. A backup taken of a busy database
  would carry more unreplayed log; `bcdb check` prints the log size.
- `money`, `sql_variant`, `xml`, sparse columns: the reader throws, naming the
  column and type. In a `.bacpac` the same applies to `smalldatetime` and
  `datetimeoffset`, whose row framing no observed export exercises; because an
  unknown column width makes the rest of the row unreadable, the whole table is
  refused, not just that column.
- A `.bacpac` whose `Origin.xml` declares a Data stream version other than 2.0.0.0:
  the row framing was derived for 2.0.0.0 only, so the reader throws.
- `bcdb restore` does not create anything: no database, no table, no index, no
  schema. The target database and its tables must already exist — that is what
  installing the extensions into the container does. It also does not read or write
  a service tier's configuration, so an environment still has to be told about the
  data the ordinary way.
- On Linux the binary now needs ICU present (`libicu`), the way any other
  non-invariant .NET application does. `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, which `restore`
  uses, refuses to initialise under .NET's globalization-invariant mode, so the
  build cannot enable it any more. Windows and macOS are unaffected.
- In a `.bak`, varchar/char/text bytes ≥ 0x80 decode as Latin-1; a customer
  database with a different single-byte collation could map 0x80–0x9F differently.
  This does not apply to a `.bacpac`, where those columns are written as UTF-16.

## Verification

`./verify.sh` is the full gate: it re-decodes the fixture tables from the real
files (the two demo backups from the BC artifact cache, the committed type-probe
backup, and the committed type-probe bacpac) and compares byte-for-byte with
fixtures exported from a real SQL Server holding the same data. It **fails** when the demo backups are
absent; it never skips silently.

`dotnet test` runs the hermetic suite (unit tests plus the full pipeline against
`fixtures/typeprobe.bak`) everywhere, including CI. Tests that need the ~900 MB
demo backups report as **skipped** when the files are absent — and CI asserts
they were skipped, so a green run cannot mean "tested nothing".

`bcdb restore` is verified the same way, in two tiers. What it decides (which
tables and columns map, what it refuses) and how it converts every value is
hermetic: the conversion tests take the type-probe backup's `probe_notnull` — every
supported type as `NOT NULL`, at its extremes — convert each cell the way the load
would, and compare the result against the `SELECT` output a real SQL Server
produced for it. That the rows then *land* needs a server, so it is a skippable
integration test: point `BCDB_RESTORE_SQL` at one and it writes into a scratch
database and reads the rows back with SQL Server's own `SELECT`.

```
BCDB_RESTORE_SQL='Server=localhost,14330;User ID=sa;Password=…;TrustServerCertificate=True' \
  dotnet test BcDb.sln -c Release
```

`./verify.sh` passes the oracle in and **fails** if those tests report as skipped.
